# Translating InvoicePlane

InvoicePlane is a multilingual application, and we rely on community contributions to keep translations up to date. If you want to help translate InvoicePlane into your language, follow this guide.

## üåç Where Are Translations Managed?

All translations for InvoicePlane are hosted on **[Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/)** under the project **FusionInvoice**.

## üîπ How to Contribute

1. **Sign up for a Crowdin account** at [crowdin.com](https://crowdin.com/).
2. **Request access to the FusionInvoice project** by searching for `FusionInvoice`.
3. **Choose a language** from the available options. Languages follow **short codes** (e.g., `en`, `de`, `fr`).
4. **Start translating** missing strings or improving existing ones.
5. **Submit your translations** for review.

## üìú Translation Guidelines

- Follow existing terminology to ensure consistency.
- Do **not** translate placeholders like `{invoice_number}` or `{client_name}`.
- Keep the formatting intact, especially in Markdown or HTML-based text.
- If unsure, ask in the **InvoicePlane Community Forums** before making significant changes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

- Translations are stored in `.php` language files inside `application/language/`.
- Directory is long form of the language, **lowercase** ('english', 'german', 'french')
- Each language has its **own folder** (`application/language/english/`, `application/language/german/`, etc.).
- The structure inside each folder should match the default **english (`english`) translation**.
