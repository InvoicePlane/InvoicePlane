Since the start of the project in 2014, InvoicePlane evolved into a software used worldwide.
However, it is still developed in our free time, as a hobby.
We do your best to fulfill any legal requirements but please note
that we cannot make sure that the app is working 100% correctly.
Also, due to the fact that InvoicePlane is a free and open source software without an income,
there are no professional audits of the app yet.

### Quick Installation

1. Download the latest version [from the InvoicePlane website](https://www.invoiceplane.com/downloads).
2. Extract the package and copy all files to your webserver / webspace.
3. Make a copy of the `ipconfig.php.example` file and rename this copy to `ipconfig.php`.
4. Open the `ipconfig.php` file in an editor and set your URL like specified in the file.
5. Open `http://your-invoiceplane-domain.com/index.php/setup` and follow the instructions.

_Notice: Please download InvoicePlane from our [website](https://www.invoiceplane.com/downloads) only as the packages contain additional needed components.
If you are a developer, read the [development guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)._

#### Issues

Before you report an issue, try your best to make it reproducible.

Something like "_It doesn't work_" will not help in finding your issue.

We've improved the github issue template to help you answering the most common questions that are needed for reporting an issue.

Try to report your issue on the forums first: https://community.invoiceplane.com

Once the issue is _reproducable / replicatable_, you will be asked to create an issue in the issues list.

#### Remove `index.php` from the URL

If you want to remove `index.php` from the URL, follow these instructions. However, this is an _optional_ step and not a requirement. If it's not working correctly, take a step back and use the application with out removing that part from the URL.

1. Make sure that `mod_rewrite` is enabled on your web server.
2. Set the `REMOVE_INDEXPHP` setting in your `ipconfig.php` to `true`.
3. Rename the `htaccess` file to `.htaccess`

If you want to install InvoicePlane in a subfolder (e.g. `http://your-invoiceplane-domain.com/invoices/`) you have to change the `ipconfig.php` and `.htaccess` file.
The instructions can be found within the files.
