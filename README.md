### Quick Installation

1. Download the latest version [from the InvoicePlane website](https://invoiceplane.com/downloads).
2. Extract the package and copy all files to your webserver / webspace.
3. Make a copy of the `ipconfig.php.example` file and rename this copy to `ipconfig.php`.
4. Open the `ipconfig.php` file and set your URL like specified in the file.
5. Open `http://your-invoiceplane-domain.com/index.php/setup` and follow the instructions.


_Notice: Please download InvoicePlane from our [website](https://invoiceplane.com/downloads) only as the packages contain additional needed components. If you are a developer, read the [development guide](DEVELOPMENT.md)._

#### Remove `index.php` from the URL

If you want to remove `index.php` from the URL, follow these instructions. However, this is an optional step and not a requirement. If it's not working correctly, take a step back and use the application with out removing that part from the URL.

1. Make sure that [mod_rewrite](https://go.invoiceplane.com/apachemodrewrite) is enabled on your web server.
2. Set the `REMOVE_INDEXPHP` setting in your `ipconfig.php` to `true`.
3. Rename the `htaccess` file to `.htaccess`

If you want to install InvoicePlane in a subfolder (e.g. `http://your-invoiceplane-domain.com/invoices/`) you have to change the `ipconfig.php` and `.htaccess` file. The instructions can be found within the files.
