French system language set for CodeIgniter
==========================================

CodeIgniter is a PHP framework published by EllisLab.

This repository is one of my independent contributions to the framework. It contains all versions of the french language set since release 1.6.1.

Each release exists as tag (current CI convention) and as branch (more suitable for my workflow).

From time to time I synch CodeIgniter's develop branch with this master branch and translate the added entries. As of now I do not use a develop branch on remote.

To just download a specific version as .zip:

1. Choose the version in the branch drop-down
2. Download the selected version by clicking on the ZIP button

You find other sources of CodeIgniter language files / translations on the CodeIgniter Wiki [Language Translation](https://github.com/EllisLab/CodeIgniter/wiki/Language-Translation).
