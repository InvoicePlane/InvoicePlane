## üìú Translation Guidelines

- Use consistent terminology (reference existing translations).
- **Do not translate** variables like `{invoice_number}` or `{client_name}`.
- Preserve all formatting (e.g., Markdown, HTML, newline breaks).
- Ask in the [community forums](https://community.invoiceplane.com/) if you're unsure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details (for Developers)

- Translations are stored in `lang/{locale}/` using Laravel conventions.
- File format is PHP: `lang/en/invoices.php`, `lang/fr/clients.php`, etc.
- Language folders use **short codes**: `en`, `de`, `fr`, `es`, etc.
- Do not edit translation files manually. All changes should go through Crowdin.
