For a full list of known issues, see the issue tracker
<http://code.google.com/p/dompdf/issues/list>.


      Installation Notes

  * Starting with DOMPDF 0.6.0 the dompdf.php script will no longer
    allow conversion of HTML document on the local file system that are
    located outside of the path specified by DOMPDF_CHROOT
    <http://code.google.com/p/dompdf/source/browse/tags/dompdf_0-6-0_beta3/dompdf/dompdf_config.inc.php#109>
  * If you are installing DOMPDF on top of an existing installation you
    should remove any existing font metrics. This can be done manually
    or through the sample website (www/fonts.php).
  * When upgrading to a new version of DOMPDF you must replace
    dompdf_config.inc.php with the new one. To simplify the upgrade
    process you can store your configuration settings in
    dompdf_config.custom.inc.php (which does not need to be overwritten).

    dompdf_config.custom.inc.php.
